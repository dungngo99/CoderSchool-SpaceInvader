# CoderSchool - * Dung, Space Invader *

Game created with love by: Dung Ngo
Template created with love by: Charles Lee (Founder at CoderSchool)
  
This is a simple Canvas-based game that requires a solid understanding of the principles of JavaScript programming to customize. 

## Video Walkthrough
Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories.

## Required User Stories
- [x] I have at least three code reviews from others.
- [x] The user can move their character with the arrow keys. 
- [x] The user can see a monster.
- [x] The game ends when the user defeated all monster or time out. The total time elapsed is displayed upon game completion, in seconds.
- [x] The user can access this game from the internet (e.g. using Netlify).
- [x] The code has been reviewed by at least one other person, using Pull Requests on GitHub.

## Optional User Stories
- [ ] Custom styling: the developer has replaced the images for the main character, monster, and background with something of her choice.  
- [ ] The user cannot move her character off the screen. 
- [ ] The user sees a few different types of monster each time a new monster is spawned. 
- [ ] The monster moves around on its own each frame, and the user must chase it.

## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: 2 days spent in total.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app
1. Make sure that every interaction between user and program is consistent and has no lags
2. As the game becomes more complicated, every change needs to be careful and thoughtful
